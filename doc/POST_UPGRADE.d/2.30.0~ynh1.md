There are a lot of broken plugins after the 2.30 migration.

In order to migrate your blog, we had to deactivate all plugins by creating a `_disabled` file inside each plugin folder located in `__INSTALL_DIR__/plugins/`.

Please remove these `_disabled` files one by one and make sure your blog is still working after each deletion.
